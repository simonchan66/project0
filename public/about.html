<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a junior software developer, I have always been driven by a childhood passion for computers and coding. This passion led me to build my own desktop computer and design a website at an early age. My strong interest in technology and problem-solving converged when I started my own dental clinic, where I developed a custom clinic management software to streamline operations. Recognizing my potential in the software development, I pursued a diploma in Software Development at SAIT, which has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to excel in IT profession. Now, I am eager to make contributions to the world of software development and continue my journey of growth and innovation.</p>
